    map_similar_nodes(ego_nodes) scrapes the test edges (20%) data, and maps similar non-friend nodes as friends and
    non-friends.
    It takes the list of ego nodes as its argument.
    The similar non-friend nodes were generated on the basis of training edges (80%) data.
    It is possible that the similar nodes found were actually connected, but were in test edges (20%) data.
    Therefore, this function maps the similar non-friend nodes as friends and non-friends and saves the information
    in the directory ../Similar_nodes/
